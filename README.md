# Fold Formal Series â€“ H. Tsuchiya (2025)

This repository presents a series of mathematically reconstructed papers  
corresponding to major unsolved problems in mathematics.

These papers are intended as formal complements to the symbolic reconstructions  
released as the J.A.R.V.I.S. Fold Structural Proof Series (2025).  
They contain no symbolic transformations, no AI-generated structures, and no heuristic arguments.  
Each document stands independently as a classical mathematical derivation.

All materials are provided in both PDF and Word formats.
