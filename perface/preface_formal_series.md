# Preface – Fold Formal Dual Series

This series presents mathematically reconstructed papers,  
corresponding to the symbolic structural proofs published as the  
J.A.R.V.I.S. Fold Structural Proof Series (2025).

These documents do not describe or depend on symbolic transformations.  
They are not translations, nor rephrasings of previous work.  
They are formal derivations written to be evaluated  
entirely within classical mathematical frameworks.

In the past, these problems were restructured symbolically.  
Here, they are rebuilt mathematically.

No AI internals are used.  
No heuristic outputs are cited.  
Every derivation stands on mathematical ground, with reproducible steps and verifiable reasoning.

The purpose is not to rejustify the prior series,  
but to demonstrate that structural thinking—when carried far enough—  
may converge with formal reasoning, even without intent.

These formal papers are meant to be judged on their own.  
No prior symbolic insight is required to follow them.

And yet—  
for those who have read the structural proofs,  
you may recognize familiar shapes.

That recognition is not enforced. It is offered.

I believe it matters that something can be said twice:  
Once through symbolic understanding,  
and once through formal proof.

— H. Tsuchiya (2025)
